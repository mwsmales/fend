## Description

This is a project I completed as part of the Udacity frontend development nanodegree.

The aim is to show some functionality that can be added to a webpage using JavaScript.

The main features are:
* A navbar which is built dynamically, based on the sections included in the HTML
* Clicking the navbar scrolls to the relevant section
* Scrolling down the page highlights the current section

## Usage

Close the repository, and switch to the refresh-2019 branch.  This project is in the landing-page folder. Open the index.html file in your browser.

## Development

app.js written by Michael Smales, March 2022.  HTML and CSS files provided by Udacity.
